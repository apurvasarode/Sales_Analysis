# Sales_Analysis

We are going to utilize Python Pandas and Python Matplotlib to examine sales data and address business inquiries regarding a year's worth of sales data, involving a vast amount of purchases from an electronics store categorized by month, product type, cost, purchase location, etc.

The initial step is data refinement, entailing the following actions:

1. Eliminating rows with missing values from the DataFrame.
2. Excluding rows based on specific conditions.
3. Altering column data types using methods like to_numeric, to_datetime, and astype.

Following a preliminary data cleanup, our focus shifts to the data exploration phase. In this segment, we delve into five overarching business inquiries tied to our data:

1.What was the peak sales month, and how much revenue was generated during that period?
2. Which city recorded the highest product sales?
3. What timing is optimal for showcasing advertisements to enhance the probability of customer purchases?
4. Which products are frequently sold together?
5. Which product exhibited the highest sales figures? What factors contribute to its exceptional performance?

To address these queries, we employ a variety of techniques provided by Pandas and Matplotlib, including:

1. Merging multiple CSV files to construct a fresh DataFrame using pd.concat.
2. Introducing additional columns to the DataFrame.
3. Parsing cell contents as strings to generate new columns using the .str method.
4. Utilizing the .apply() method for transformations.
5. Employing the groupby function to conduct summarized analysis.
6. Generating bar charts and line graphs to visually represent outcomes.
7. Incorporating labels into our graphical visualizations.
